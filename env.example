# TrueBlocks docker -- example .env file
#
# In order for this package to work, it needs a `.env` file in the local folder. This present
# example file can serve as the basis for your `.env` file. Simply copy this file to `.env`
# and things should just work. If you experience a problem, it's most likely related to the
# RPC provider. Pay careful attention to that value.

# This first value points to your RPC provider endpoint. If you're running your node
# locally -- you should be! -- use docker's naming conventions for local hosts. If your RPC
# endpoint is remote or on a different local machine than this host, use your endpoint directly.

# This variable specifies which chain `chifra` operates on in the absence of the `--chain <chain_name>` option.
TB_SETTINGS_DEFAULTCHAIN=mainnet

# This variable, while optional, allows chifra to "articulate" transactions (that is, convert byte data
# into human readable text). If you try to use a command that requires this value, you will get notified.
# You may obtain this key at https://etherscan.io. It's likely you'll want to specify this value.
#TB_KEYS_ETHERSCAN_APIKEY=<your_key>

# This variable is only required if you are interested in pinning the Unchained Index (and thereby
# sharing it with others). Please see the documentation for more information.
#TB_SETTINGS_DEFAULTGATEWAY=https://ipfs.unchainedindex.io/ipfs/

# These three variables are only required if you are interested in pinning the Unchained Index (and thereby
# sharing it with others). Please see the documentation for more information.

#TB_KEYS_PINATA_SECRET=<your_secret>

# The following variables dictate how chifra operates on startup.

# When the container starts, it starts `chifra scrape` against the given chain. Use these values (which
# must be specified per chain) to send command-line options to the scraper. See `chifra scrape --help`.
# No additional options is the default.
#SCRAPER_MAINNET_ARGS=
#SCRAPER_MAINNET_FILE=

# When the container starts, it starts `chifra monitors --watch` against the given chain. Use these values (which
# must be specified per chain) to send command-line options to the scraper. See `chifra chifra monitors --help`.
# No additional options is the default.
#MONITORS_WATCH_FILE=
#MONITORS_WATCH_ARGS=

# The following variables specify settings for a given chain. You may specify more than one chain.
#
# The MAINNET, SEPOLIA, and GNOSIS chains are preconfigured and will only require you to set the
# `_RPCPROVIDER` value. See the README and the documentation for more information on supporting
# multiple or custom chains.
#
# To support other chains, replace the word MAINNET in the variables (both above and below) with the
# name of your chain. (Update the `_DEFAULTCHAIN` value above if you wish.) In order to access other
# configured chains, use the `--chain <chain_name>` command-line option.
