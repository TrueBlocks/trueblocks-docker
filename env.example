# This is an example `.env` file. Copy this file and rename it if you wish.

#---------
# To various degrees, TrueBlocks runs against any evm-based blockchain (although we only officially
# support `mainnet`, `sepolia`, and `gnosis`). Specify the default chain you wish to use. The default
# chain is the one `chifra` processes if you don't specify a `--chain` parameter.
#---------
TB_SETTINGS_DEFAULTCHAIN=mainnet

#---------
# For each chain you wish to support, you must instruct TrueBlocks how to connect to it. Below, we
# configure for "mainnet" and "sepolia". If you wish to support other chains, add their RPC providers
# below. Variables are named as follows: TB_CHAINS_<chain>_RPCPROVIDER. The value provided should be
# the URL of the RPC provider for the chain. It's highly suggested that the URL is local. 
#---------
# Note: The following values most likely will not work on your machine. Replace these vaules with
#       values that work on your machine. The values below work for us on a Mac running Docker Desktop.
TB_CHAINS_MAINNET_RPCPROVIDER=http://host.docker.internal:8545
TB_CHAINS_SEPOLIA_RPCPROVIDER=http://host.docker.internal:8546

#---------
# This value, which is optional, enables the articulation feature. Eventually, we will provide a
# way to use the articulation feature without an API key. In the meantime, you can get an API
# key from https://etherscan.io/apis.
#---------
TB_KEYS_ETHERSCAN_APIKEY=<not-set>

#---------
# These two paths, while optional, allow us to more easily use the data produced by TrueBlocks
# outside the docker image. We recommend you leave these settings as they are.
