# There are many things you can do with a docker-compose file. Here we simple attach the internal-to-docker
# folders to the external-to-the-host folders we've described in the .env file. This is a good way to
# keep your data safe and persistent.
#
# Note that the name of the service (`core`) must match that found in `docker-compose.yml`. Also, we've
# found that the easiest way to get this to work is to make the `source` and `target` paths absolute.
