# This file gives an example of how one might customize this docker contain to expose its
# internal folders to the host machine. The majority of the configuration for this container
# is found in the file `docker-compose.yml`. Do not need to edit that file. Instead, customize
# this file after copying it to `docker-compose.local.yml`
#
# It is important to use the file name `docker-compose.local.yml` as it is ignored in `.gitignore`.
#
# Once your customization is complete, you may start the container with:
#
#    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up
#
# The settings in this file expose the internal docker folders externally on the host machine
# (i.e., the machine on which this docker image is running). One might want to do this in order to
# get direct access to the Unchained Index, the cache, or -- most importantly -- the exported data.
#
# Note that we customize the same services as those found in the `docker-compose.yml`. We expose the
# container's internal folders to the host machine with the `bind` directive. The following assumes the
# existance on your host machine of a folder called /Data. You may adjust this location.
#
# Bind the same folders for each service (/cache and /unchained). The `source` folder is the name of the
# folder on the host machine. The `target` is the name of the folder internal to the docker image.
#
